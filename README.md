# GitHashingExercise

#Create a script in a shell of your choice named hash_script, where it should take a 4-digit integer as input and output a hash #of the input. You can use any standard hashing algorithm (like SHA-256), run the script with your unique 4-digit integer and #save the output in a file named hash_output.txt
